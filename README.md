# How Much Space Has Been Explored? Measuring the Chemical Space Covered by Databases and Machine-Generated Molecules

Thanks for your interest! This is the code repository for our ICLR 2023 paper [How Much Space Has Been Explored? Measuring the Chemical Space Covered by Databases and Machine-Generated Molecules](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yo06F8kfMa1).

Chemical space measures including `#Circles` as we proposed in the paper are defined in `measures.py`. 

Please find the implementation of the explorative MARS algorithm in [this repository](https://github.com/yutxie/MARS-explore).
